/**
	
So far just hold the light color parameters and the location.

  Orientation is also stored even though a rotated point source
  is indistuinguishable from the non-rotated.

  There's also a visible .obj shell around the light in order to 
  make placement possible (rather than guessing the lights position
  by looking at it's effect on normal objects).

  There's no diminishment with distance, that would be interesting to
  implement and though I can think of at least one way to do it 
  (objects would be individually lit with a distance scaling factor,
  and perhaps the distance to the light would also have the object
  be split up for lighting in order to show a differential across
  it's surface), I'm curious what the conventional way is.
